// implemented addition, substraction, multiplication, division, left shift, right shift, operator overloading 
// improve->
decimal to binary (reverse double dabble)
complete karatsuba
work on 32 bit arithmetic 

7.6.21 : implemented substraction and sign handling
8.6.21 : operator overloading, removed cyclic referance for addition, added comaprators, removed dependency on length 'l'
9.6.21 : part of multiplication and double dabble for easier debugging :: fix issue with multiplication
10.6.21: multiplication complete(O(n^2))
16.6.21: Added integer division
17.6.21: left shift and right shift now works for all integer shifts, organised code to create a include file
